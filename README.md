#Esgela - Online Coding Bootcamp
Welcome to Esgela, an innovative online coding bootcamp designed to make high-quality coding education accessible to anyone, regardless of location or financial background.

Currently, the website you are viewing is a visual prototype showcasing the front-end of the platform. The full website, which will include both front-end and back-end functionality, is still under development. We are working hard to integrate a full backend solution powered by Node.js and MongoDB to handle user data, courses, and progress tracking. Please check back soon for updates on our full-featured platform!

About Esgela
Founded by Onwabe Zibeke, a dedicated software developer and graduate of Durban University of Technology (DUT) in 2022, Esgela is a mission-driven organization based in the rural town of Port St. Johns. Onwabe's vision is to break down barriers to education, providing free, accessible coding education to individuals in underserved areas.

We aim to empower learners by providing high-quality training in web development and other essential coding skills that are critical for success in the modern tech industry. Whether you're just starting or looking to level up your skills, Esgela offers a range of courses that cater to all levels:

HTML (Fundamentals of web design)
Typing Test (Improve your typing speed and accuracy)
JavaScript (The core language for web development)

Our mission is simple: to unlock opportunities for individuals by providing them with the tools they need to succeed in the rapidly growing tech industry.

Current Development Status
This website is built using React for the front-end and styled with TailwindCSS to ensure a responsive and modern user interface. The Node.js back-end is under active development, and we are in the process of integrating MongoDB to handle user authentication, data storage, and more.

What’s currently available:
Front-end visuals: The website displays the design and layout for the bootcamp platform, giving users a glimpse into the final product.
User interface: Clean, responsive design built with React and TailwindCSS.
What’s still under development:
Back-end functionality: The back-end, powered by Node.js, will include authentication, course management, and user progress tracking.
Database integration: We are integrating MongoDB to manage user data and store course-related information.
The platform is still evolving, and we are working hard to bring the full website to life. Stay tuned for updates on new features and improvements as we continue building the platform.
